abstract=The Intelligent Tourism and Recommendations ontology provides a framework for modeling key concepts, entities, and relationships within the domain of smart tourism.
It captures knowledge about accommodation options (such as hotels and rural hotels), restaurants, and their associated attributes like names, prices, and types. 
Using OWL and SWRL, the ontology supports intelligent reasoning over tourism-related data, facilitating advanced recommendation systems and decision-making.
It enables interoperability, data integration, and querying within tourism information systems.

description=The Intelligent Tourism and Recommendations ontology provides a detailed semantic representation of the tourism domain, with a focus on intelligent data processing and personalized recommendations. 
It is built using OWL (Web Ontology Language) to ensure logical consistency and interoperability, and it incorporates SWRL rules to enable inference and reasoning.

Core Concepts
Hotel: 
Represents general lodging businesses. It is a superclass for more specific types such as RuralHotel. 
Each hotel is described using properties such as hasName, hasStarRating, and hasLocation.

Restaurant: 
Represents food establishments. 
Restaurants are modeled with attributes like hasAveragePrice, hasCuisineType, and locatedIn, enabling filtering and recommendation based on customer budget and tastes.

TouristAttraction: 
Captures points of interest such as monuments, museums, or natural parks. 
These are usually the main reasons to visit a particular city.

Properties
Object Properties: Define relationships between instances of different classes. Examples include:

locatedIn – connects a hotel or restaurant to a Location

operatedBy - connects a public transport service to the company that operates it.

Data Properties: Define literal attributes. Examples include:

hasName – assigns a name to a hotel, restaurant, or location

hasAveragePrice – expresses cost information, for filtering options based on budget

hasRating – allows representation of user ratings on a 0 to 5 scale.

Individuals
The ontology contains a rich set of individuals (named instances) that represent actual or example entities such as hotel_97, restaurant_38, and specific City instances. 
These individuals are populated with data that allows reasoning engines to simulate recommendations or answer semantic queries.

Rules and Inference
Using SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language), the ontology supports rule-based reasoning to infer new facts. 
Inside Protegé (The software used to develop the ontology) the reasoner used was Pellet.

Extensibility
The ontology is designed to be extensible and adaptable. 
New classes, properties, and individuals can be incorporated as the need arises.

introduction=In recent years, the tourism industry has experienced growing availability of digital information and an increase in the demand for personalized experiences. 
Tourists today seek tailored recommendations that align with their preferences, budgets, and travel purposes. 

Semantic technologies and knowledge representation techniques offer powerful tools to enhance information systems.

The Intelligent Tourism and Recommendations ontology has been developed to address this needs. 
It is a machine-understandable model of the tourism domain in Spain. 
This ontology defines the core concepts related to tourism—such as hotels, restaurants, types of lodging, pricing, etc.
It supports the semantic integration of data from diferent sources and enables advanced reasoning capabilities through 
the use of OWL (Web Ontology Language) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language).

Designed to serve for intelligent recommendation systems, the ontology aims to support the development of applications
that can guide users when planning their trips.
