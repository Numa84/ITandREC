In recent years, the tourism industry has experienced growing availability of digital information and an increase in the demand for personalized experiences. 
Tourists today seek tailored recommendations that align with their preferences, budgets, and travel purposes. 

Semantic technologies and knowledge representation techniques offer powerful tools to enhance information systems.

The Intelligent Tourism and Recommendations ontology has been developed to address this needs. 
It is a machine-understandable model of the tourism domain in Spain. 
This ontology defines the core concepts related to tourismâ€”such as hotels, restaurants, types of lodging, pricing, etc.
It supports the semantic integration of data from diferent sources and enables advanced reasoning capabilities through 
the use of OWL (Web Ontology Language) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language).

Designed to serve for intelligent recommendation systems, the ontology aims to support the development of applications
that can guide users when planning their trips.
