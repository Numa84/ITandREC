The Intelligent Tourism and Recommendations ontology is structured to represent key concepts and relationships within the tourism sector, 
with a focus on enhancing data interoperability, semantic reasoning, and personalized recommendation capabilities. 

Built using OWL and enriched with SWRL rules, the ontology provides a semantic foundation for tourism-related applications.

The ontology is composed of:

Classes (Concepts): 
The ontology defines 47 classes that capture the entities in the tourism domain. 
These include core concepts such as Hotel, RuralHotel, Restaurant, TouristAttraction, and Location. 
Subclass relationships are used to express hierarchical structures (e.g., RuralHotel is a subclass of Hotel).

Properties (Relationships): 
A total of 15 properties describe how classes interact and what attributes they possess. 
These include object properties such as locatedIn and data properties like hasName and hasAveragePrice. 
These properties enable the ontology to represent contextual information.

Individuals (Instances): 
The ontology includes numerous named individuals that represent real or hypothetical instances of hotels, restaurants, and other tourism-related entities. 
These instances are annotated using rdfs.

Rules and Constraints: 
The ontology incorporates SWRL rules to define logical conditions and enhance inference capabilities.
These rules allow the system to derive new knowledge.

The ontology is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration with other domain ontologies.
